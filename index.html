                    <h3>Embedded Systems</h3>
                    <p>I have exposed myself to the wonderful world of enbedded and electronics systems as a Mechatronics student. I have experienced working with the Arduino Uno and Raspberry Pi for a few projects at the UW Robotics team. 
                        
                        <p>
                            I have also designed and bulit a working robot called the ShotBot(TM) with the LegoEV3 and Tetrix prime kits, which used several sensors and algorithms to process
                            the sensor information, so that the robot can help in shooting with a high accuracy rate. I had worked on intergating the LiDAR system for 
                            the University of Waterloo's Robotics team's autonomous robot racing car- The HummingBot. More about these can be found in the projects section.
                      
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        I am now in the Electrical subeam of the University of Waterloo's Formula Electric design team, where I have done BOM managament and helped the team
                        with wire harnessing. Currently, I am looking into the problems faced by the Wheel Sensor Board (WSB) on the team's car.

            <h2 class="section__title section__title--about">Who I am</h2>
            <p class = "section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">Mechatronics engineering student @ University of Waterloo</p>
            
            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>Born and raised in the lovely Arabian country of Oman, I always fell in love with robotics after attending a robotic 
                    conference at the local conference grounds. As of now, I am a student at the University of Waterloo, pursuing my B.A.Sc 
                    in (Honours) Mechatronics Engineering and will be specializing in Artificial intelligence systems. As seen from my skills, 
                    I have been trying to make my life long experience in many electromechanical 
                    systems as I always wanted to be an engineer that makes products for the betterment of humanity, especially in robotic systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I would like to state that I am a team player and can assume any role in a team. 
                    I am goal-oriented and possess very strong work-ethics. I like and respect every individual for who they are. 
                    This quality has helped me grow tremendously as a person and I continue to grow along with people around me. 
                    I try not to miss any opportunity to learn a new skillset or a new piece of information. 
                    You’ll find me to be an enthusiastic, honest and friendly person with a pleasing personality. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I am not doing academia or robotic related things, I love to use my guitar playing skills by playing for the local choir when I'm back home in Oman,
                    or just playing the guitar casually in my free time. I also love to play Football and E-sports games such as Counter Strike, League of Legends, and even Genshin Impact!
