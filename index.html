            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>Born and raised in the lovely Arabian country of Oman, I always fell in love with robotics after attending a robotic 
                    conference at the local conference grounds. As of now, I am a student at the University of Waterloo, pursuing my B.A.Sc 
                    in (Honours) Mechatronics Engineering and will be specializing in Artificial intelligence systems. As seen from my skills, 
                    I have been trying to make my life long experience in many electromechanical 
                    systems as I always wanted to be an engineer that makes products for the betterment of humanity, especially in robotic systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I would like to state that I am a team player and can assume any role in a team. 
                    I am goal-oriented and possess very strong work-ethics. I like and respect every individual for who they are. 
                    This quality has helped me grow tremendously as a person and I continue to grow along with people around me. 
                    I try not to miss any opportunity to learn a new skillset or a new piece of information. 
                    You’ll find me to be an enthusiastic, honest and friendly person with a pleasing personality. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I am not doing academia or robotic related things, I love to use my guitar playing skills by playing for the local choir when I'm back home in Oman,
                    or just playing the guitar casually in my free time. I also love to play Football and E-sports games such as Counter Strike, League of Legends, and even Genshin Impact!
